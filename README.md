# random_scripts

A collection of random scripts that I write, that aren't big enough to need their own repo.

## Why?

I tend to write small scripts that are certainly useful, but don't really deserve  their own GitHub repo. So, this was born.

## List of scripts.
* Python
	* token_generator: Generates random strings from a set list of characters.
	* grammar: Contains grammar related functions.
* C
	* easy_rng: Simplifies sudo random number generation in C.
* C++
	* clipcopy: Simple CLI tool to copy a string of text to the Windows clipboard.
	* pwgen: Simple command line tool to generate passwords.
